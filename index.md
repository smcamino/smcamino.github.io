I recieved my Bachelor's degree in statistics and mathematics with a minor in Computer Science at the University of Wyoming. I was born and raised in Wyoming but I currently reside in Raleigh while I persue my Master's degree in statistics. 

I'm currently in a data science course at NC State so this blog will be filled with all sorts of data science fun!

My family owns a ranch back home so enjoy this picture of our sheep!
