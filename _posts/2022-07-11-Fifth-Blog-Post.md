================

All current thoughts in terms of using R for data science are positive!
I definitely see myself using R going forward. I loved R so much coming
into this class and this class only made me appreciate it more. It’s so
user friendly and if I can’t figure something out, there’s so many
resources on Google.

This course opened my eyes to TidyVerse and there’s no turning back now.
I can’t believe I used R without knowing that TidyVerse existed.The
plots in ggplot are beautiful and chaining a ton of functions together
is life changing. I’m excited to use it in practice and continue
learning about all you can do with it.

After I graduate this program (After this semester! Yay!), I’ll be
getting a certificate in Data Science in SQL and Tableau. I’m excited to
learn SQL and add that skill to my skill bucket. I think data science
would be fun to explore further. I’ve enjoyed this class a ton and I
think the material is very interesting.

Thanks for the good semester!
