For Project 2 my partner, Tommy King, and I practiced automating the
creation of documents using R Markdown. We outputted 6 html documents
for one of the each data channels, lifestyle, entertainment, business,
social media, tech, and world, from [UCI Machine Learning
Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity).
For every data channel we subsetted data for that specific topic,
performed a brief EDA with plots and numerical summaries, created four
models, two linear regression models, one random forest models, and one
boosted tree model, and then compared the models and found a winner.

If I were to do this project again, I would spend more time on the EDA.
It was hard to limit myself to a few plots and numeric summaries. My
statistical brain wanted to dive deep and find everything out, but that
couldn’t really happen since everything needed to be automated and the
analysis would be different for each channel. I don’t think spending
more time would improve the project, it just would’ve been fun!  
I learned how to work with someone else on GitHub so that’s probably my
biggest takeaway. It was way cool being able to work on the same project
at the same time. I wish I would’ve known how to do this sooner, but I’m
glad I know how to do it now.
